Custom Post Type Maker lets you create Custom Post Types and custom Taxonomies in a user friendly way. Originally by [Bakhuys](http://www.bakhuys.com/).

## Description

Custom Post Type Maker is the perfect plugin to create Custom Post Types and custom Taxonomies in a user friendly way, just like managing your regular posts and pages.

## Installation

1. Upload `custom-post-type-maker` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Click the new menu item 'Post Types' to create a Custom Post Type or a custom Taxonomy

## Additional configuration

You can add `CPTM_DONT_GENERATE_ICON` in `wp-config.php` to prevent CPTM to generate the 16x16px WordPress image_size. You can do this after you upload an initial icon.
We've added this option because some users have very large image galleries and the additional WordPress image_size matters.
